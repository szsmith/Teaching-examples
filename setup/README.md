Setup
=========
Sets up the Jupyter notebook with a template of markdown, adds user-defined default imports,
and prompts users to rename the notebook if it's currently called "Untitled".
Edit the template or default imports in `main.js`

This extension is a work in progress and any help would be appreciated. Feel free to make contributions
on GitHub or contact the author (Samuel Smith)
Add the files of main.js, and setup.yaml and this README.md file into a folder titled 'setup' in your 'nbextensions' folder.
For example my path of this file is located here: "~\anaconda3\envs\py37\Lib\site-packages\jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\nbextensions\setup\README.md"

#orginal idea from
#https://school.geekwall.in/p/SJqkD2VDE/set-your-jupyter-notebook-up-right-with-this-extension

#use this command to update the main.js file when needed for new templates(do this after you add files to your extensions library)
#jupyter contrib nbextensions install
